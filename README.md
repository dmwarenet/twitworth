Twitworth

This was a small side-project done with web.py and Postgres a couple of years back. 
It used the older HTTP Authentication based twitter API, and would calculate your social worth in dollars ;).

Klout and similar companies had not been started yet when this was online.

Usage
-----

It should be easy to setup the database with the SQL files provided, or you can use the script

    ./loaddb.sh

You should be easily able to setup uWSGI for web.py and get the same running
